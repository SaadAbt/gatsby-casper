**A few things you should know upfront**:

Cyberspace now constitutes a new space of confrontation, just like land, air, sea and space.
It therefore has a strategic dimension, and constitutes a new operational domain for armies because of the contribution of information systems to the effectiveness of the defense tool.

## How?
